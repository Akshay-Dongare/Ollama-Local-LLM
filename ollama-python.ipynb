The atmosphere contains tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which scatters the sunlight in all directions.\\n\\nRayleigh scattering is a process where shorter wavelengths of light (such as blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (such as red and orange). This means that the blue and violet lights are dispersed in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance.\\n\\nThe reason why the sky appears blue during the daytime is because the sunlight is the main source of light, and it is scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. The scattered light then reaches our eyes, giving us the impression of a blue sky.\\n\\nAt night, the sky can appear dark because there is less scattering of light by the atmosphere, and the Earth is in the way of the sunlight, blocking it from reaching our eyes. However, if there are enough stars or other sources of light in the sky, they can be visible even in the absence of direct sunlight.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the color of the sky can appear to change under different conditions, such as during sunrise or sunset when the light is scattering through more of the atmosphere, giving rise to colors such as red and orange.\"},\n",
