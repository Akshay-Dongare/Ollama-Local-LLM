      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance. The red light, on the other hand, travels deeper into the atmosphere and is absorbed by the atmosphere, which is why it appears darker from the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blue color of the sky can also be affected by other factors such as air pollution, dust, and water vapor. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by particles in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of Rayleigh scattering, which scatters shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more than longer (red) wavelengths, giving the appearance of a blue sky.\n"
